# Musicology
The corpus I chose consists of songs from the Musical genre as I have always been awed by the extensive stories that can be told through musical theatre. However, people often assume songs from these stage productions fall under the same category as songs from Disney movies. I beg to differ as I believe Disney is more focused on sales and making profit, which results in simpler, catchier and more shallow songs than non-Disney writers and composers who are more likely to tell an important and extensive story which aims to provide an emotional immersive experience for its audience members. I want to look into this difference. 
I consider Disney’s staged adaptations to be between staged shows and Disney movies, as those productions are said to be “the musical department of Disney” rather than “the Disney department of musicals”, and I want to look into this as well.
Extremely typical (profitable) Disney songs are “Let it go”, “How Far I’ll Go” and “You’re Welcome”. It is notable that these songs are accompanied by visualisations best achieved through animation. 
Typical musical songs are “One day more”, “Non-stop” and “Seasons of Love”. They often have a big ensemble contribution or are the somber soliloquies.
